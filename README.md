This is a personal project that I would like to share with the PEOPLE. It applies automatically for job on your behalf. The program needs some modification on your part to work for your case. Please change the pixel parameters depending on your screen and personal settings, and your general email content preference. 

These are the required steps to make the script work:

. Type the type of company you want to apply to on google. Example "Bars Barcelona":

. Click on the google maps extension of the search (unfortunately if the google maps option doesn't show up the script won't work correctly):

. Run the script.


This project was made for fun, meaning nothing is optimized or scalable. If you're interested in making the script better (generalize the pixel inputs on all types of screens, ask for email info and encrypt them or optimize the program etc...) , please don't hesitate to send me a pull request or an email (sailjlad@gmail.com), I'll be glad to take a look.
